# University6Mans
Welcome to the University 6 Mans bot open source project. This was developed with the intention of making the best scrimmage bot avaliable for the UK university community, and grew into something much, much, more!

The server now has over 1,000 players from around the world.
Join here to see it in action: https://discord.gg/hu95nXR
Or you can visit the website: http://university6mans.com/

This covers everything to do with the Discord bot and website.

For more information or questions please don't hesitate to contact me on Discord: Doppla#1337

## What does this project do exactly?
The idea of this project in the simplest form is to create a Discord bot that allows players to join a queue by doing !q in the #queue channel.
Once 6 players have joined the queue, voting then takes place (teams can be randomised, balanced based on their mmr on the server, or captains can be chosen).
Players then need to report the match results in the #report-scores channel for mmr to be calculated and the stats updated.

There is a fully fledged website to go along with this for users to be able to see leaderboards and stats in one centralised place.
There's even individual player stats pages that can be tracked!

## Required 
You will need:
 - XAMPP (for running the database)
 - Visual Studio Code
 - Node.js v13 (current build)


## Running Locally
Upload the database and run Apache & MySQL on XAMPP. Then hit F5 in Visual Studio Code.

You will need to run: "node i"
In the terminal for it to grab all of the modules required on first starting the project.
